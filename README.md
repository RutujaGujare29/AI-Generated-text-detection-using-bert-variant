# Using-DistilBERT-model-to-classify-essays-as-AI-or-Human-written

**Objective**
The advance of AI driven tools such as ChatGPT has provided students with numerous benefits
such as the fast access to information, language learning and most importantly, the assistance
on essay writings (Rejeb et al., 2024). On one hand, the introduction of these technologies has
greatly improved the student’s productivity via the tool’s capability to extract the most relevant
information within minutes and enhanced the student’s learning experience.

The wide use of these tools such as the GPT has also resulted in the exploitations that lead to violations of academic integrity. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated analytical model that can accurately differentiate between essays written by
humans and those generated by AI and thereby assisting institutions in preserving academic
honesty.
